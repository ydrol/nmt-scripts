Hi,

==Mission 70==
Regarding my refund request, opening the speaker revealed why it was damaged.
The drive units had been replaced with inferior ones. In effect it was no longer a "Mission" speaker.


I've added some pictures so you can see.

==Here is the original unit in good working order:==

==Here is the unit that fell apart:==

*No Foam*

*the drives are completely different*
*and the shiny blue capacitor is missing.*

*the bass drive is clearly a cheap one, and its also damaged.*

*The tweeter unit, has actually broken in half. *

This is the rear of the tweeter.

And still inside the box, is the front of the tweeter including electrical mountings
(note they are different to the original unit)
